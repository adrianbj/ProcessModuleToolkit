ProcessModulesMigrator
=======================

#WARNING - ALPHA CODE - ONLY USE ON TEST INSTALLS!

Allows automated migration and installation of modules from one PW to another.

* During the import, you can choose which modules from the collection to import.
* Optionally import the module config settings for each module from the source install.
* Optionally update all of the imported modules (if they are in the ProcessWire modules directory) to their latest available versions.
* It copies the module files, as well as the config settings, so you can use it to migrate modules that are not available in the PW modules directory, or on Github.
* Full restore feature in case something goes wrong / you change your mind.


##Usage
Go to the Setup Page > Modules Migrator and follow the prompts.
